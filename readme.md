#Top 3 recommendations

##What is Top 3?
Top 3 is a web application that allows users to view or share recommendations to help people discover new products and experiences.

##Customer Problem?
Today it is difficult to scope down and discover new products. It takes extensive research and time. For example, if you want to buy a new video game or skincare product you have to read through several articles and reviews from multiple sources. Top 3 will help you reduce the time it takes to discover new products and experiences by providing you direct access to user generated recommendations that you can trust.
